Menubar [dtime](https://github.com/ofhippo/dtime) clock shows dtime hours.

Full dtime available via tooltip on mousing over or by clicking the tray icon.

Developer note: To build .jar: rm dtimetray.jar; warble jar; open ./dtimetray.jar

Basically, this is just a prototype working with a very limited understanding of the java libraries.
