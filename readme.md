Menubar (dtime)[https://github.com/ofhippo/dtime] clock, shows dtime hours

Full dtime available via tooltip on mousing over.

Unfortunately, .jar requires the hours.png to be in same directory.

To build .jar: rm dtimetray.jar; warble jar; open ./dtimetray.jar

Basically, this is just a prototype working with a very limited understanding of the java libraries.
