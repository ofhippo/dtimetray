Menubar (dtime)[https://github.com/ofhippo/dtime] clock, shows dtime hours

Full dtime available via tooltip on mousing over.

Unfortunately, .jar requires the hours.png to be in same directory.

Code is aweful but it seems to work. Some obvious performance boosts could come from figuring out how to render text in the menubar.

To build .jar: rm dtimetray.jar; warble jar; open ./dtimetray.jar

Basically, this is just a prototype working with a very limited understanding of the java libraries.
